I recently read part of "You Don't Know JS" and I've made it through a couple chapters and it is a good read. A little hard to grasp at first as it just a lot of words but given enough focus it has good information. Prototypes are definitely and properties are definitely one of the things that stick out most to me. 
It is amazing when I first started learning javascript I thought it was just simple code but there is a lot of things going on. Being able to set the property of objects I found to be interesting, like why is this allowed, what use can you get out of this and how often people actually play with setting properties. Definitely, something I will have to do research on and learn why it exists, but the idea is cool I could see some possible use cases such as a variable that needs to stay constant unless explicitly changed.
The book really helps bring out the fact that at the end of the day all javascript is, is Objects and functions. Even so-called "classes" are not a class as defined in other code languages but rather just an object that can contain other objects.
My understanding as grown some from reading this. I feel though if I could find a video to go along with all that is explained it would help out so I'll have to find that later. My plan to keep getting better, I thought I knew all there was to know about javascript found out I still have more to learn even if it's not everyday use its good to learn.
