Growing up I use to look at the world around me and wonder how did they build that? Why did they build it like that? Use to wonder if i should go be an architect or engineer. 
The more I learn about coding the more i see the possibility, the more I understand how applications and the web work. It is really cool it's a different type of building but in reality it is building your building a application out of nothing but words and it all comes together harmoniously. I intend to keep learning and keep seeing how much of the software world I can understand.
