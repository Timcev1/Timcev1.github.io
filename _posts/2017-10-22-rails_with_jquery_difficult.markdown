Going into this project I thought I might have a hard time. The idea of adding javascript to my project sounded like a huge task. But actually turned out great. Jquery is quite straight forward get this object do this send this here. Rails with Jquery feel like a full enough base to make any website really with enough time and work, can't wait to find out what else is out there and to put my knowledge to work. I feel as if I barely have even scratched the surface of what is capable with javascript and the various sub-languages. Hopefully with this strong base I can grow to be a great programmer and use Jquery to get this and send it to the world wide internet.
