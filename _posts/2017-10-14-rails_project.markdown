As much as I like challenges this project was rough. It took me quite some time to get it all to work, It took alot of debugging and two help sessions but it finally paid off. It is now functioning fully and looks decent. I shouldve had this finished about a month ago but due to the hurricane I was unable to work on anything due to lack of power. But I have come back with my goal fresh and I am ready to finish and learn.
