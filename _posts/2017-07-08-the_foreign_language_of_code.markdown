  People tend to think of code as hard and complex. The truth though is it isn't acutally that foreign, the most smiliar thing to it would have to be learning another language. When you first start learning the new language you first learn common nouns and verbs. Same is true for coding you first pick a language then you start out with the basic commands. An example is with javascript youd first learn about a functions how you use them what they do, then move on to the harder things such as functions within functions. Then as with languges you would find shortcuts, smiliarites, or ways to make it easier once you understand the basics same happens with javascript you start out doing everything doing everything yourself thinking hard then you move using things such as jquery and handlebars, increasing what you can do with less thought.
  Beyond just being similiar to learning a language the coding process is simliar to dealing with problems in life. How can i accomplish this task? If i do this what would happen? The same questions i consider when writing code I see the problem or the thing i want to accomplish and try to put it in a way that makes sense to me and will output the results I want. As with our life we can always turn to search engines to find a answer however just like with life you cant just copy and paste the answer cause you may want different results from a smiliar problem. So the key is learn from others but don't copy and paste and expect the same results everytime cause just like with life things change and one thing won't solve all your answers.
	So the thing is code isn't foreign its a language of problem solving that builds the digital world and with it you can create amazing things so deal with it like life keep learning and figuring our the answers to problems and you can accomplish anything.
