The building block of some major sites, I can see the potential in it. To me one of the more annoying parts is simply dealing with all the different pieces you have to have like three files to complete one task. But it is powerful and I would like to continue to play with it and learn because you can do quite alot with it.
  The project started out difficult because I was confused on where to start but I eventually found a video on it and feel kinda confident in my understanding now. Sometimes the worst part of a new project is simpliy staring at blank pages and 1 file and wondering where to take it from it there. But it is fun to have that challenge and see how you build app from nothing. Redux definitly makes react easier helping to deal with states. After learning about React I now wonder what webpages are just single pages and which ones are a real web definitly will have to do some playing around as I search the web.
	The whole course really has made me think of the web as a whole differently. There is a lot of different appoaches one can take each with its own downsides. I plan on continue learning so I can one day teach others about how the web is made up.
