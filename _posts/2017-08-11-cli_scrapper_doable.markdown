The cli scrapper project was hard to start. I started looking like well were do i begin? I had to look at the previous scrapper assignments to begin and see what I needed to do. Then I set it all up from there the next challenge I had was just seeing where to begin scrapping. Each website has their own way of putting the information using different names different methods so you just have to figure what is going on then figure out how your going to extract the information from there. 
Once i finished that there was just the putting it all together in a readable way that people could understand and making it cli friendly. I  shall see how it all works together and hopefully I did it all right. I shall see what they think.
