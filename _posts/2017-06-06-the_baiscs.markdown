  People have always told me how hard coding is, but for me the more i keep learning the more i want to learn. I know the languages we are learning are simple but when I play a game for example I am able to more understand of what is going on in the background just by understanding these simple languages. I have heard that learning a coding is like learning a real language and I have to say its a fairly accurate way to desribe it.
   A lot of what I have been working on lately has to do with Ruby I can see why its popular. Athough I have not been in an actual programming envirmont from what I am learning I can see the power in such a simple language. I was recently doing the lesson on hashs and that is realy cool what is possible from that. Being able to put mutiple arrays and other hashs all into one hash to contain various but related information is really cool, and I can see it having potential.
  I look forward to continue my learning and hope to become a master in at least one of these languages by the end. As it stands now I can see the code and understand whats going on but my goal is to see a problem and understand how to write a code for it without much assistance from the web or others, wish me luck as i continue this journey.
