  My name is Timothy, I have recently found a way to get myself into starting a new path in life. I found a way to leave the career choice I didn't really choose or not choose just happened to do. It is not that I'm not good at it, it's just not what I want to do.

  Working in the kitchen I found myself just watching my life pass by and people do things I wish I had the time to do. So, I decided it was time to make a change, I went to research various careers paths. I ended up deciding on computers because I am good at them and always have been. First path I looked at was network administrator sounded great, fun, and different. But I came to the conclusion I think I could find something a little more flexible, which bought me to web design/coding.

	I was able to find various programs to help me start, make sure I can even accomplish the task to even think of making it into a career and not just a side job. Found out I’m pretty good at it, so I kept going and eventually decided to go for it. I was able to become pretty good at deciphering what was going on behind the code but I still needed help writing it from scratch.

  I decided I’d take a look at different programs to help me accomplish the task, the problem is I don't have much money or anyone to borrow from so I had to find something that was going to be flexible and online. Eventually I found learn.co and I liked the way the trial was so I saved up some money, worked real hard and after couple months I decided to go for it. 

  That is the story of how my new life has started. Hoping to get a better life work balance, and actually learn and challenge myself mentally each day rather than just work for the hours or paycheck. I am hoping I can continue to learn and grow with the knowledge I learn from Learn.co, and who knows maybe I’ll do so well I'll move up to program/app development or game development and make the next big game. The sky seems to be the limit with coding which is what I like, so wish me luck, look for my name on websites cause I’m reaching for the stars.
