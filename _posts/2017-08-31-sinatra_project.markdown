I started out excited for this project with a decent idea. But dang routing is annoying and error prone. The idea was to build a simple web app where people could post their computers specs and others could see it. Allowing the owner to edit their projects and delete them. I went through a couple ideas on the project first thinking each component could be its own table but that wouldve led to alot of complexity so settled on a simple two table build with the necessary fields in it, allowing much easier creating. The end result is ok needs alot of css and html and I would acutally like the look of it, but it still functions so thats good. Looking forward to the next one to see what I can do.
